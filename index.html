                  <p>I was born in Carbondale, PA, snuggled in the Pocono Mountains â€“ so, yes it was cold with loads of snow! While living there I walked to two miles in the snow up to my waist everyday to get to school! Well maybe not that much snow, but the distance was two miles. Just like everyone who wanted a season ski pass, I worked winters at Elk Mountain, the local ski resort. Gradually, the snow lost its appeal, or maybe it was the -40 degree mornings. 
                  So here I am, living in Miami.</p>
                  <p>Being in the sub-tropics, I definitely do not miss the bone-chilling winters, but sorely miss the smells of spring and the colorful cool crisp fall. Here, each day seems to litterly melt into the other. I, as others, long for the Miami 'winter' so we may wear our boots, sweaters and an occasional scarf.</p>
                  <p>My college education consists of two associates degrees. The first in Math/Science and the second is Business.
                  Presently I am working at The Growing Place preschool as an Anministrative Assistant, resopnsible for student files and parent communication. I assist the teachers, administration and parents with registration, information and help them in any way possible. </p>
                  <p>I am a mother of two children...a high school daughter and a middle school son. My goal in life is to make them proud. Showing them that you are always able to learn something new.</p>
